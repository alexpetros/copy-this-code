# Copy This JS
Don't add it to your `package.json`. Don't credit me. Just copy the code into your project if you
think it's useful.

## Rationale
I am often surprised at how easy it is to implement a lot of the things that we routinely turn to
libraries for. I'm creating a little space for myself to save these snippets so that I can refer to
them.

I will probably share links to this repo with people, but it's not intended to be a definitive
archive of anything at this point. Use at your own risk.
