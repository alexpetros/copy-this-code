# Copy This JS
Don't add it to your `package.json`. Don't credit me. Just copy the code into your project if you
think it's useful.

## Rationale
I don't want to make any sweeping statements about dependency trees just yet, but suffice to say
that I am often surprised at how easy it is to implement a lot of the things that we routinely turn
to libraries for. I'm creating a little space for myself to save these snippets so that I can refer
to them.

If/when I'm ever ready to say that this is an **authoritative way to do something** like, say,
escape HTML, I will update this README to say so. Until then, and after then, use at your own risk.
