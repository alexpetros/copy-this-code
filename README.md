# Copy This JS
Don't add it to your `package.json`. Don't credit me. Just copy the code into your project if you
think it's useful.

## Rationale
This repo serves two purposes: one personal and the other pedagogical.

First, it reflects my understanding of the best way to do various common tasks in JavaScript.  I am often
surprised at how easy it is to implement a lot of the things that we routinely turn to libraries
for. I'm creating a little space for myself to save these snippets so that I can refer to them.

The second purpose is to challenge myself and, eventually, others, to better develop a sense of when
it is worth learning how something is done versus accepting someone's interface for doing it. To use
escaping HTML as an example: you can accept Jinja or Spring's interface that "makes HTML safe" for
you, or you can learn what it means to safely template HTML yourself, and in the process learn
exactly how an XSS attack works.

If you copy one of these files and then I learn I was wrong about something, you have inherited that
mistake and the need to correct it, as my update will not save you. On the other hand, the process
of reading and copying code forces you to accept responsibility for it in a way that importing a
library does not; you're already better equipped to fill the gaps than if you'd simply taken my word
for it, as a publisher on the Node Package Manager repository, that I know what I'm doing.

I will probably share links to this repo with people, but it's not intended to be a definitive
archive of anything at this point. Use at your own risk.
